    """Snap a desired workspace-split-K partition count UP to the nearest
    `splitk_p_ladder` rung, then CAP at `p_max` -- a CAPTURE-INVARIANT ceiling
    (see `ws_p_ceiling`: one GPC wave's SM-fill `sm_count // raw_grid`, or a
    shape-driven `target` above it once one wave alone is small).

    The ladder is shared with `fa4_splitk_combine`, which compiles one unrolled
    combine per rung -- so a rung added here automatically gains its
    specialization there. NOTE the cap is NOT snapped: when `p_max` bites, the
    returned `P` is off-rung and the combine takes its generic runtime-`P`
    kernel. That is the common case when the ceiling binds off-rung
    (B200: 37 through `raw_grid <= 24`, then decaying), so the
    static-`P` win is not available there.

    `raw_grid` (`prompt_tiles * kv_heads * batch`) is INVARIANT within a CUDA-graph
    capture: batch is fixed per capture, kv_heads per compilation, and seq len per
    decode/EAGLE config (prefill is uncaptured). So `p_max` is a single fixed value
    per capture -- launching it EXACTLY costs no extra captures. The ladder's job is
    only to bound the distinct `grid.x` values the `num_keys`-driven ramp
    (`by_cache`) produces BELOW `p_max`; the top is reached exactly via the cap, not
    by a rung. Bucket-UP then cap; over-bucketing past `by_cache` (but never past
    `p_max`) is correctness-safe: surplus partitions get empty KV windows, write
    `lse = -inf`, and the combine folds them (M2). Mirrors the
    `_bucket_num_partitions` idiom in `mla_decode_dispatch.mojo`.

    The ladder's rungs below 12 (`2, 4, 6, 8, 10`) exist so a SHORT cache at a
    mid/high-batch
    `raw_grid` (small one-wave, boosted `p_max` -- see `ws_p_ceiling`) doesn't
    over-split: callers used to guarantee `n > 10` before ever reaching this
    ladder (the old crossover gate required the desired count to beat the whole
    cluster ladder top), so starting at 12 never wasted more than one rung of
    slack. M4 removed that gate (desired count and mechanism are chosen
    independently now), so a `by_cache`-bounded `n` as small as 1 can reach here;
    without low rungs it would jump straight to 12 partitions for a cache that
    barely supports 1-2. `2`, `4`, and `10` also double as the fill-all-SM cluster
    candidates (`_cluster_splitk_candidates`), so an `n` that lands exactly on one
    of them buckets to a cluster-compatible value instead of overshooting it.

    `raw_grid` is capture-invariant (see `_bucket_ws`), so this is a single

    Why plateau at `WS_RAW_GRID_CLAMP == 4`, checked against a measured
    B200 ragged partition sweep (batch sweep at cache=131072): a flat
    MULTIPLE of `one_wave` reproduces the moderate-batch optimum
    (`3*one_wave` at batch=22, `one_wave==6` -> 20, close to the measured
    workspace optimum) but ALSO scales up the already-good small-`raw_grid`
    case into a measured regression (that same `3x` turns batch=4's
    `one_wave==37` into 111, ~45% slower than 37). Clamping `raw_grid` instead
    leaves batch=4's 37 untouched -- it is exactly `sm_count // 4` -- and
    lifts a small one-wave (batch=22's 6) to 37. The forced workspace P-sweep
    at batch=22 peaked at P=47, so 37 undershoots that peak by ~10-25% rather
    than matching it; `4` is the largest clamp that does not push batch=4
    past its own measured optimum (P=49 costs batch=4 ~7-10% versus its P=37
    peak). All four route arms in that sweep peaked in roughly the same
    absolute-P band, so this is shared across 1Q/WS-G/WS-E rather than
    per-route.

    Beyond the sweep, the inverse target keeps the split grid near a fixed

](mask: MaskType, num_keys: UInt32) -> UInt32:
    """The key count a split-K partition ladder should actually be sized
    against: how many keys the mask leaves visible, not how long the cache is.

    Split-K `P` divides the key range that a SINGLE query tile iterates, so the
    right measure is that per-tile band width, `num_keys - start_column`. This is
    the same quantity `mha.mojo`'s FA2 decode correction computes
    (`partition_num_keys`), and the same frame the FA4 warps work in
    (`load_warp.mojo` iterates KV from `start_column`; `mma_warp.mojo` calls its
    `num_keys - start_column` `v_eff_keys`).

    Evaluated at the LAST query row, which needs no prefill/decode distinction:

    * `Null` / `Causal` / `CausalPadding`: `start_column` is identically 0, so
      the row is irrelevant and the result is exactly `num_keys` -- every such
      shape keeps a bit-identical `P`, and this whole correction is inert.
    * `SlidingWindow*` / `Chunked`: the band is ~`window` wide at EVERY row, and
      the last row is the one whose band width this expression reports
      faithfully (`num_keys - (num_keys - 1 - window)`). Taking the first row
      instead would report `window + max_prompt_len` and under-correct long
      windowed prefill.

    So there is deliberately no `max_prompt_len` test and no prefill/decode
    split here.

    WHY `start_column` AND NOT `total_iters`: `total_iters` is the tighter
    quantity (it also bounds the RIGHT edge) but it is NOT host-callable for
    every mask -- `CausalPaddingMask.total_iters` dereferences its
    `valid_lengths` tensor, which lives in DEVICE memory, so calling it from this
    host-side dispatch segfaults. `start_column` is host-safe for every mask in
    the tree (`CausalPaddingMask` delegates it to `CausalMask`, and
    `MaterializedMask`'s naive scan exits on the first tile because its
    `status()` is a constant `PARTIAL_MASK`), and `mha.mojo` already depends on
    exactly that property. Using `num_keys` as the right edge instead is
    conservative: it can only over-estimate the band, i.e. never under-partition.

    COST: O(1) for every mask that can reach here. The only two masks whose
    `start_column` still resolves through the linear
    `naively_get_first_nonempty_mask_col` scan are `MaterializedMask` and
    `AndMask`, and both report `UNKNOWN_MASK`, which every caller gates on
    (`ws_mask_ok` / `ws_e_mask_ok` / `ws1q_mask_ok`) before calling this --
    split-K is comptime-pruned for them. `OrMask` -- hence `ChunkedCausalMask`,
    the Llama4 production mask -- is closed-form (`mha_mask.mojo`'s
    `max(lhs, rhs)`), so it costs two child `start_column` calls, not a scan.

    Parameters:
        MaskType: Concrete `MHAMask` implementation to query (inferred).
        BM_mask: Query tile height the kernel masks against, i.e. the route's
            `config.PairBM_eff()` -- matching every FA4 warp's `BM_mask`.
        BN: Key tile width in columns.
        page_size: The KV cache page size in key columns (0 or 1 if unpaged).

    Args:
        mask: The mask functor.
        num_keys: Raw batch-max KV length (`max_cache_valid_length`).

    Returns:

        """Traditional (unfused / workspace) split-K launch: run the plain 1Q
        config over an over-launched grid that writes each partition's
        locally-normalized `O_p/l_p` + fused per-row LSE to a transient
        `o_partial`/`lse_partial` global workspace, then merge them into `output`
        with a separate `fa4_splitk_combine` kernel (same stream, so it runs after
        the attention completes). No launch cluster, no in-kernel DSMEM combine.

        `p` is both the grid over-launch factor (`block_x *= p`) and the
        workspace row extent, and every launched CTA writes a real or
        `-inf`-empty row, so it is also the count the combine reduces.
        `SplitKPartition` keeps `num`/`max` as separate fields (FA2 decode does
        distinguish them); should this route ever over-launch, split this
        parameter rather than the struct.

        The config itself stays at `splitk_partitions == 1` (so
        `cluster_size() == 1` and `cluster_dim=None`) and `P` is carried purely
        at runtime by the `SplitKPartition`. That partition SCHEME is a comptime
        TYPE flowing into `with_fa4_config`, which is why this is a separate
        generic `def` rather than a `comptime if` selecting a shared
        `var partition`: Mojo unifies a `var`'s type across both branches, so
        both ctors would have to type-check. Same idiom as
        `with_valid_length[NonNullPointer]` vs `[NullPointer]`.
