"""KV cache connectors for external cache tiers.

    A single connector serves every DP replica for all connector types:

    select the replica via ``replica_idx`` (SERVOPT-1501). The host/disk tiers
    back this with one shared pinned host buffer / disk cache, which the tiered
    connector sizes from the config's ``host_offload_max_gb`` /
    ``disk_offload_max_gb`` (or from its own device page pool when either is
    unset); the distributed ``dkv`` connector owns one Rust client per replica
    internally.

    ``tiered`` is a backward-compatible alias for the Rust ``rust_tiered``
    connector, which replaced its deleted Python implementation, and therefore
    inherits ``rust_tiered``'s CUDA/HIP requirement.

    Args:
        devices: Devices for the KV cache tensors (all participating devices).
        replica_kv_memory: Per-replica offload-ready KV memory units (one inner
            sequence per DP replica).
