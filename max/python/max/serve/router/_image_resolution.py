"""Resolve and validate image references from chat-completion requests.

Turns the ``image_url`` / ``video_url`` references in an OpenAI request into raw
image bytes (from ``http(s):``, ``data:``, or ``file:`` URIs) and fully decodes
them once for validation. Kept in its own module so the image-resolution
concern stays focused and out of the much larger ``openai_routes`` handler.
